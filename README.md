# üöïDBSCAN---Data-Clustering-Algorithmüöï
This is a Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise. Using a dataset of taxi trip records in New York City, in 2009, 
I identified the best waiting areas for vehicles. Since the taxi's are located in relatively small areas, I can simply use the Euclidean distance 
between the GPS coordinates.

<h2>‚òïJava Implementation‚òï</h2> 

<h4>I Used 3 Different Objects </h4> 
<br>
<strong>GPSCoord</strong> which held the GPS coordinate of the taxi's starting location.  <br> <br>

<strong>TripRecord</strong> holds information read from the CSV file: the date,the pickup location,the drop off location and the trip distance. I used the TripRecord as a sort of pointin my DBScan algorithm so we can consider TripRecords as part of clusters or Noise.  <br> 

<strong>Cluster</strong> class holds the average GPS coordinate as well as the list of TripRecord held in a Cluster. These Clusters are used to calculate and held values that will be listed in a csv file.  <br> 


Finally TaxiCluster holds all the the DBSCAN algorithm itself as well as a multitude of helper function to read the csv file,calculate distances and create csv files

<h2>üêªGo Implementationüêª</h2> 

<h4>I Used Concurrency in this implementation </h4> 
<br>
This implmentation uses structs instead of classes and follows the same principles as the java but utilizes concurrency<br>
<br>
I use the producer consumer pattern. The producer that produces jobs for each partitions and the consumer that consumes each one.<br>

------------------- RUNING THE CODE -------------------

To compile and execute: go run map.go

EPISLON : 0.0003
MINPOINTS : 5

To change number of consumer threads you can change varaible "NumberOfConsumerThreads" on line 80

------------------- EXPERIMENTATION -------------------


N=2 and 4 consumer threads = Execution time: 40.465053292 of 198194 points <br>
N=4 and 4 consumer threads = Execution time: 9.904227896 of 206102 points <br>
N=4 and 10 consumer threads = Execution time: 10.876244625 of 206102 points <br>
N=10 and 4 consumer threads = Execution time: 2.769759061 of 222488 points <br>
N=10 and 10 consumer threads = Execution time: 2.397145154s of 222488 points <br>
N=10 and 50 consumer threads = Execution time: 2.857153542s of 222488 points <br>
N=20 and 10 consumer threads = Execution time: 2.232980004s of 255300 points <br>
N=20 and 50 consumer threads = Execution time: 2.274099476s of 255300 points <br>
N=20 and 200 consumer threads = Execution time: 2.582893006s of 255300 points <br>
